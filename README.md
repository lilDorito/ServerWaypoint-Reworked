Unofficial fork of **Server Waypoint** for Forge 1.20.1, maintained by lilDorito. It fixes waypoint sync breaking after players respawn, shows server waypoints in Xaero's Minimap and World Map for every player,
and stores waypoints per world on dedicated servers. See [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

- Support adding waypoint conveniently from Xaero's minimap waypoint chat sharing message without requiring client side installation.

## Dependencies
Required:

Optional:

  - [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)

## Keybinds
- Press `Right Shift` (default keybind) or use `/wp_gui` to open the waypoint manager screen in game.
- In the waypoint manager screen, hover over a waypoint and press `T` to teleport (requires `/wp tp` command permission).

- `/wp tp` teleport the executor player to a waypoint

## Server-side Translations
Messages and command feedbacks sent by this mod will be automatically translated based on the language setting on the receiver's client. This works entirely on the server-side; players can see the translated message without client-side installation of this mod. Right now, the mod comes with translations for English and Simplified Chinese. If you’re interested, you can help out by adding translations on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/server-waypoint)!

- ### Add translations
  Place the lang files under the directory: `<config-path>/server_waypoint/lang/`. This mod will load them on server starting, use `/wp reload` if the server is already running.
  
- ### Create a lang file
  Follow the format used in [`en_us.json`](./common/src/main/resources/lang/en_us.json), [`zh_cn.json`](./common/src/main/resources/lang/zh_cn.json).

  Name the lang file with a [valid language code](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language#Languages).

- ### Translation order
  If the translation you’ve added uses the same language code as the built-in language, this mod will try to find the translation key in the file you added first. If that key isn’t there, it’ll fall back to the built-in translation. So, if you’d like to use your own translation version, you can easily do that by adding your own file and overriding the built-in translation.

Community translator credits and credit pull request guidelines are documented in [`TRANSLATOR_CREDITS.md`](./TRANSLATOR_CREDITS.md).

## Waypoints
- #### Location
  For a dedicated server:
  
  `<config-path>/server_waypoint/waypoints/`

  For a single player world:

  `<minecraft-root>/saves/<world-name>/server_waypoint/waypoints/`
- #### File Format
  All waypoints are saved in json files. Each json file contains all waypoints in one dimension and the filename is the converted full registry name of that dimension.
  For example, all waypoints in the overworld is stored in `minecraft$overworld.json`.

## Server Configurations
Fabric, Quilt:

`<minecraft-root>/config/server_waypoint/config.json` 

NeoForge, Forge:

`<minecraft-root>/defaultconfigs/server_waypoint/config.json`

Paper, Purpur:

`<server-root>/plugins/ServerWaypoint/config.json`

Some changes made in `config.json` may take effects after server restarts.

- ### Command Permission
  Changes the vanilla [permission level](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Permission_level) required to execute the command.
  
  This will be overridden by the permission set by [LuckPerms](https://modrinth.com/plugin/luckperms).
  
  Default value:
  ```json5
  {
    "CommandPermission": {
      // /wp add
      "add": 0,
      // /wp edit
      "edit": 0,
      // /wp remove
      "remove": 0,
      // /wp tp
      "tp": 2,
      // /wp reload
      "reload": 2
    }
  }
  ```
- ### Features
  - #### addWaypointFromChatSharing
    Default value: `true`
    
    Prompts the user to add the waypoint they shared in chat. Requires `/wp add` permission.
    
    Example:
    ```json5
     {
       "Features": {
         "addWaypointFromChatSharing": true
       }
     }
     ```
  - #### sendXaerosWorldId
    Default value: `true`
    
    Send world id to client to help Xaero's map mod recognize the server.

    **This should be set to `false` if `xaero-map-protocol` on the [Leaves](https://leavesmc.org/) server or some similar features provided by other plugin or mod is enabled.**

    Example:
    ```json5
     {
       "Features": {
         "sendXaerosWorldId": true
       }
     }
     ```

## Client Configurations
- #### Enable Waypoint Rendering
  Default value: `true`
- #### Waypoint Rendering Scaling Factor (Percentage)
  Default value: `100`
- #### Waypoint Background Transparence
  Default value: `128`
- #### Waypoint Vertical Offset (Percentage)
  Default value: `0`
- #### Local Waypoint View Distance (Chunks)
  Default value: `12`
- #### Auto Sync to Xaero's Minimap
  Default value: `true`

  Requires Xaero's Minimap mod installed.
- #### Manually Sync to Xaero's Minimap
  Default value: `None`
  
  Triggered manually, requires Xaero's Minimap mod installed.
  
  This will replace any waypoint sets on Xaeros' Minimap that has the same name as a list on the server.
  - What stays:
  Waypoint sets with unique names that do not exist on the server.
  - What is lost:
  Any waypoints you added to these shared lists. Any list you created that happens to share a name with a server list.
